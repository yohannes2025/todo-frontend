## Design

The design of this content-sharing platform focuses on accessibility, user experience, responsiveness, and clarity. The following practices and tools were used throughout the design and development phases:

### Color Scheme

The application's color palette is designed to promote readability, engagement, and modern aesthetics. The chosen colors follow accessibility contrast guidelines and reflect a clean, professional tone suitable for content sharing:

- **Buttons**: #0d6efd and #198754 – Bootstrap primary and success (Buttons)
- **Background**: #f8f8f8; – Light Gray (Page background)
- **Text**: #212529 – Dark Charcoal (Primary Text)
- **Navbar**: #DFECC6 – Light Green (Navbar background)

These colors are applied consistently across components using Bootstrap’s utility classes and custom CSS variables.

---

### Typography

To ensure readability and a modern look:

- **Font Family**: `"Roboto", sans-serif;`
- **Heading Font Sizes**: Scaled using Bootstrap's heading classes (`h1`–`h6`)
- **Body Font Size**: `1rem` with responsive scaling
- **Font Weight**: Used to distinguish hierarchy (e.g. `600` for headings, `400` for body text)

Typography is responsive and consistent across components to maintain design uniformity and accessibility.

---

### Wireframes

Wireframes were designed during the planning phase to define layout, content structure, and user flow. They include:

- **HomePage** – Main landing page
![home_wireframe_pc](./src/assets/images/home_page_wireframe_pc.png)
![home_wireframe_mobile](./src/assets/images/home_page_wireframe_mobile.png)
![home_page_pc](./src/assets/images/home_page_pc.png)
- **Profile** – User profile page
![profile_wireframe_pc](./src/assets/images/profile_page_wireframe_pc.png)
![profile_wireframe_mobile](./src/assets/images/profile_page_wireframe_mobile.png)
![profile_page_pc](./src/assets/images/profile_page_pc.png)
- **Settings** – App and account settings

![create_task_page_pc](./src/assets/images/create_task_page_pc.png)
  - Edit Task
![edit_task_wireframe_pc](./src/assets/images/edit_task_page_wireframe_pc.png)
![edit_task_wireframe_mobile](./src/assets/images/edit_task_page_wireframe_mobile.png)
![edit_task_page_pc](./src/assets/images/Edit_task_page_pc.png)
  - Task List
![task_list_wireframe_pc](./src/assets/images/task_list_page_wireframe_pc.png)
![task_list_wireframe_mobile](./src/assets/images/task_list_page_wireframe_mobile.png)
![task_list_page_pc](./src/assets/images/task_list_page_pc.png)


Wireframes were created using Balsamiq and informed the React component structure and routing. All major interface elements were validated against the wireframes before implementation.
